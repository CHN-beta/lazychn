This is my personal overlay.

I switched from archlinux, and found many packages missing in gentoo, so I decide to package them by myself. As I am a newbie to gentoo, I can not expect perfection of every ebuild files, but I could guarantee that they all do work on my laptop. Because I am not familiar with open source licenses, and some of the ebuild script is actually copied from other place (such as aur and gentoo official repo) with just a little modification, I also could not figure out which license to use, so I just write down the source in the comment of each ebuild.

The procession of packaging is far from finish, I may add new packages as often as a few days. I also plan to move some of the packages to gentoo-zh, but currently I have doubts about the quality of my packaging especially license concerned parts.
